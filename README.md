# FX-82au plus II reverse-engineering

This is a reverse-engineering project for the CASIO FX-82au plus II scientific calculator.
I'm still new to C so pls don't judge.

Most of the data labels are from [user202729's work on CASIO calculators](https://github.com/user202729/fxesplus/blob/master/82espa/labels)
